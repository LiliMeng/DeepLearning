2. to compute the predictions for
the following test dataset of three observations and two input features (fertilizer and
insecticide):
dataTest = torch.Tensor{
{6, 4},
{10, 5},
{14, 8}
}
What are the values of the three parameters? What happens to the parameters and
predictions when the number of epochs is either 1e3 (1 × 103
) or 1e5 (1 × 105
)? Hand in
the answers to these questions.

3. Implement the least squares solution θ = (XT X)
−1XT y using the same dataset. What
are the predictions for the above test set? How do they compare to the predictions of
the linear neuron trained with SGD? How do the parameters compare? Hand in your
answers.
